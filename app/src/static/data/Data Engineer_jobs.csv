Software Engineer,"Executive Level 1, Non-ongoing$100,075 - $112,725 + 15.4% superAll State and Territory Offices will be consideredThe Research Program of the Bureau of Meteorology is seeking an advanced software engineer with some computational science and / or data science and data engineering experience to be a key member of an innovative multi-disciplinary team with IT and science specialists which improves weather forecast guidance for operational forecast production staff. The focus of this work is on collaborative development, testing and documentation of weather model Ensemble Post Processing (EPP), including statistical analysis, science, software and systems. EPP bias-corrects, combines, downscales and produces weather event probabilities from different state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction guidance. The post-processed guidance supports communication of forecast uncertainty to users, and requires less editing by weather forecasters, allowing for a more efficient high-impact forecast process.   Core competencies include excellent software engineering ability, experience in developing complex scientific or engineering applications suitable for operational use, and a good grasp of computational algorithms and application to large data volumes. The focus of this position is on software engineering, but statistical analysis or machine learning knowledge and experience, including direct development of complex algorithms (and some library awareness), would be an advantage. Some background in mathematics, statistics or physical sciences is highly desirable. Experience and interest in scientific or engineering research and systems development is desirable.   The software used for EPP is written predominantly in Python with some shell scripting. It utilises third party scientific and data-handling libraries and is run on high performance Linux platforms. Operation of the applications is time-critical and will involve work-flow scheduling (EPP uses Cylc; examples elsewhere include Apache Airflow, Prefect), effective usage of parallel processing, memory and I/O on large high-performance computing systems. Experience in using configuration managers (e.g. Rose) would be an advantage. Use of modern tools and practices such as git, automated testing and deployment and code reviews is essential.   The position will also contribute to EPP science testing (evaluation and visualisation of gridded scientific fields) including through the specification and development of mostly python-based verification libraries, supporting transition to operations. You will collaboratively define, develop and support transition to operations processes, standards and capabilities including testing and deployment capabilities. You will also collaborate with: operational staff monitoring quality and execution of operational software, other Science and Innovation Group sections, areas of the Bureau managing data services, and others as appropriate.  Professional development opportunities relevant to the work will be available. This is a great opportunity to work on meaningful scientific software applications for the public good, in a research environment with a commitment to innovation and quality.Position Description - PDF Opens in new window Position Description - Word Opens in new windowHiring InsightsJob activityPosted today",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=2845af9179e07da6&fccid=248d20ccb33ad238&vjs=3,"$100,075 - $112,725 a year",Posted today,False,,Australian Bureau of Meteorology,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Australian Bureau of Meteorology,Australia,3.5,Australia,"python, ",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"airflow, ",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"git, ",N/A

Scala Backend Engineer,"At Famly, we’re looking for a Scala Backend Engineer (Copenhagen-based or fully remote) to build awesome GraphQL and REST APIs to enable our platform to help the thousands of daycares that use Famly. And Famly are...? Well it all began when our co-founder Henrik’s daughter was ready to start at daycare. He couldn’t believe the amount of work being done on paper - and how distant he felt from his first child during the day. The paper ‘parent’ books they exchanged once a month just weren’t cutting it. Together with his friend, our co-founder and CEO Anders, they set about solving that. These days, the 150 of us building Famly talk about trying to do two things for our 3,500 nurseries: Giving children the best possible start to life. Championing the vital work that goes into making that happen. We do it with software that brings hundreds of thousands of parents closer to their child’s day while they’re away from them. We also make financial, pedagogical, and planning tools for more than 34,000 childcare professionals, saving them hours and reducing their admin stress. Ultimately, that gives them more time and headspace for the little ones that really matter. Come help us make that happen. What you'll be doing:Working in one of our five crews with other frontenders, backenders, designers and product people. You’ll work in monthly cycles and cooldown periods, where you will play a key role in planning what’s next, designing, developing and rolling out cool new features and changes. You’ll team up with the Backend Chapter to shape the future of our tech stack, tooling and reducing complexity across our code. We’re heading towards a progressive remote-first way of working, where you’ll communicate asynchronously-by-default, and treat documentation as a first class citizen. You’ll thrive in this role if you can:Build solid APIs in GraphQL and REST (we use Scala for our new GraphQL API and PHP for our REST API) Use functional programming (we use cats, cats-effect, fs2, refined, and slick) Model complex data structures and express them in a relational way (we use MySQL) Bring crystal clarity to complex and ambiguous ideas and projects. Communicate feedback, expectations and information in clear and kind ways, both written and spoken (we’re over 20 different nationalities, and our company language is English) Learn super fast, be open-minded and ready to adapt our technology, teams and ways-of-working as Famly scales in brave new directions. Make your teammates shine by supporting each other to learn and grow. We’re looking for people from mid to senior, and we appreciate that everyone brings something unique, so even if you don’t tick every box, please still apply. You’ll love working here because:We’re all about hiring a diverse array of clever people - who are good humans too. It means Famly is full of top thinkers and generous teammates waiting to help you shine. We like to give a lot of ownership both in terms of responsibility and freedom to try new things. We’ll get you up and running and collaborate along the way, of course. Top-notch work equipment (including noise cancelling headphones for those focus periods!). We offer equitable perks, regardless if you work at Copenhagen HQ or remotely (that means if your Copenhagen teammates get dinner, we’ll buy you dinner in your home town too!). A big focus on people support with personal and career development, including monthly training sessions in a wide-variety of topics. A yearly training and conference budget of 10,000 DKK If you work remotely, you’ll get a coworking office budget too. If you’re at Copenhagen HQ, you can enjoy:A yummy daily buffet and a well stocked drinks fridge (did someone say snack corner?) Our private rooftop courtyard (sunny all year round, we promise…!) Post-covid social activities have now resumed… enjoy endless team fun with dinners out, office BBQs, friday bars, big quarterly social events, game nights, a daily 7 minute workout, and more! Where would you like to work from? We’re currently around 150 people, and around 35 in Engineering. We started as a Copenhagen office-based company, but as we are scaling we’re heading on our journey towards a fully remote-first way of working in Engineering. You are free to join us at the Copenhagen HQ or work fully remotely from any European-friendly timezone. We can also help you relocate to Copenhagen with our fast track visa process, if you need it. The interview process is:An intro video chat Logical test Take home technical assignment with a follow up chat Personal interviewWe're looking to fill the position as soon as possible, so get your application in today by sending us: Your CV A cover letter to tell us what you can bring to the role, and what speaks to you about Famly.

We are seeking specifically people with a passion for code and the curiosity to understand how the world works in order to find the meaning in all we do. It's definitely an asset to have a profound competence in some of the technologies we are using – or going to use. We do need people that can extend our skillset right from the beginning. But since passion and curiosity always beat skills over time, that is not the primary thing we're looking for. Our product is a wide combination of design, psychology, data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, web and mobile interfaces, various databases, cloud servers, and APIs. In the end, it's a negotiation AI that handles conversations better than human beings. To work, the system must have the best possible data available and the capabilities to figure out the next move and to generate the natural language to communicate it.

PythonREST APIsSQL (PostgreSQL) It would definitely be of help to also... Know KafkaHave experience in cloud servers (Google Cloud). What are we exactly looking for? Most likely, you have spent many years playing (i.e. trying things) with computers and done many projects either at work or in your free time. You have countless times felt the pain of banging your head on nasty problems, but you also yearn for the feeling of coming through as a winner. You know that StackOverflow has all the answers, but you have spent so many hours googling for the basic bugs that you don't get stuck on them anymore – at least daily. You have an ""anything is possible – time is the only concern"" kind of attitude. When you join us, you are going to be trusted – probably more than you'd ever expected. We are a small, fast-learning team that you can lean on and spar with, but who also expects you to look for the answers and bring solutions to the table. We trust that every one of us is actively looking for ways to make our system better, to make our customers happier, and we believe that every one of us can discover the next big idea that takes us forward. We are, above all, honest and respectful. You'll get the best tools you need and a fair salary.

Als Umsetzungsboutique entwickeln wir nicht nur zukunftsfähige Konzepte, sondern packen gemeinsam mit unseren Kunden tatkräftig an, um diese in die Realität zu bringen. Voraussetzung für all das ist eine solide Datenbasis, um die richtigen datenbasierten Entscheidungen zu treffen.           Zur Komplettierung unserer Teams suchen wir Dich als       Junior Data Engineer (m/w/d).     Eine herausfordernde und spannende Aufgabe…      Oftmals fehlt unseren Kunden die notwendige Transparenz, um die richtigen, datenbasierten Entscheidungen zu treffen und das operative Geschäft zielführend zu steuern. Und das liegt keineswegs am Datenmangel. Denn Daten gibt es in Hülle und Fülle, nur liegen diese nicht strukturiert und dokumentiert an einem Ort vor. Millionen von (Kassen-)Transaktionsdaten bleiben so beispielsweise oft ungenutzt - und damit auch die dahinterliegenden Umsatzpotenziale.           Als Junior Data Engineer (m/w/d) ist es Deine Aufgabe, diese zentrale Datenbasis herzustellen. Dazu bindest Du strukturierte und unstrukturierte Daten aus verschiedenen Kundenquellen in interne Analyseumgebungen ein und führst Plausibilitätschecks durch. Darauf basierend stellst Du standardisierte Auswertungen und Apps zur Verfügung und arbeitest eng im Team mit unseren Data Analysts.     …für Menschen mit Datenfokus.      Um dieser spannenden Aufgabe gerecht zu werden, solltest Du - neben einem Studium der Wirtschaftsinformatik o. ä. – über fundiertes Wissen in Datenmodellierung und Data Management verfügen. Du solltest geübt im Umgang mit ERP-Systemen als Datenquelle und Datenbank-Technologie sein. Sehr gute Kenntnisse und Projekterfahrung in mindestens einem Datenbank-Managementsystem (z. B. SQL-Server, MySQL, Oracle, Db2, Data Warehouse Automation) sowie im Aufbau von Datenanalyse-Tools (z. B. Qlik) setzen wir voraus.

Senior iOS Engineer,"We’re looking for a full-time senior level engineer, with 4+ years experience in the iOS eco-system. Does this sound like you? Then keep on reading! WE ARE MEMORY At Memory, we believe knowledge work is broken, but with your help we might just fix it. Powered by artificial intelligence and 50 brilliant minds, we craft software that helps people do their very best work. That includes you – we trust you to work on your own terms, define your schedule and directly influence where we’re headed. You know where you're most productive, which is why you can work from our Oslo (Norway) HQ, our Pune (India) office, or remotely from european, indian, or american timezones. Whatever works; we’re here for your best. About you: You are a confident, empathic, experienced iOS developer with a passion for building fast, functional and beautiful native applications. You can build a new application from scratch, with the same ease that you can expand and improve an existing complex codebase. You want to work for a diverse start-up with dedicated, passionate, and skilled people. Being a developer isn’t just about putting food on the table — you have a need to create. You strive to improve on your craft, code, and the people around you. You play well with others, and your written and verbal communication skills are solid. Requirements: You are located in Europe-compatible timezones, the Americas or around Pune, India, with remote working experience. 4+ years of experience with native iOS development, with extensive and up-to-date knowledge of what the UIKit and Foundation frameworks offer. You are fluent in both Swift and Objective-C. Solid understanding of iOS architectural patterns such as MVC, MVP and MVVM.

You consider testing important: When and what to test is a trade-off you know how to make. You are independent, detail-oriented, systematic and analytical. You’ve built, shipped and maintained at least one medium-large application. macOS development experience is big plus. You take pride in the work you do. Bonus points You have a solid eye for design and usability. You are knowledgeable about performance testing. You have experience working with large amounts of data on the client-side. You hate time tracking too. What we can offer: Work with a highly skilled and diverse team across the globe. A competitive compensation package and stock options in a fast-growing startup Flexible working hours and complete ownership over your schedule Autonomy as a master of your own work Direct influence over where we’re headed MacBooks are our standard, but we’re happy to get you whatever equipment helps you get your job done Technologies We Use Rails, MySQL, Redis on the backend ReactJS/Redux on the Frontend Python for data processing, machine learning and analysis Java and Kotilin on Android. ‍ Hiring Process We aim for an efficient, responsive experience. After a screening, you'll talk with some of our developers, and presume a good fit, we ask for a short coding challenge — in the handful of hours range. This will expose you to our code review process, and if all goes according to plan, a final interview with Head of Product will seal the deal. We're not huge fans of the coding challenges either, so a great portfolio of existing work can in some cases replace the coding challenge.Hiring InsightsJob activityPosted 30+ days ago",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=947b7662023a5865&fccid=e822fb394bd314e6&vjs=3,Heltid,Posted 30+ days ago,False,,Memory AS,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Memory AS,Hjemmekontor in Norge,N/A,Norway,"java, python, ","mysql, redis, ",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Lo compone un equipo pequeño, unido, joven, dinámico y flexible, que, tras varios años de trabajo en conjunto, se caracteriza por su agilidad, disfrute del trabajo y compenetración. Acorde, buscamos candidatos con ganas de innovar, lanzar un proyecto relevante y crecer con él, siempre disfrutando cada día del trabajo en equipo y de los retos, que son muchos. Nuestro “dream team” está formado por estadísticos, bioinformáticos, gente del mundo de los negocios y la medicina. En IOMED los modelos que desarrolles analizarán cientos de millones de textos hospitalarios, ayudando a extraer variables que acelerarán la investigación clínica. Como empleador, ofrecemos igualdad de oportunidades. Todavía somos un equipo pequeño y estamos comprometidos a crecer de manera inclusiva. Queremos aumentar nuestro equipo con personas talentosas y dinámicas, independientemente de su raza, color, religión, nacionalidad, sexo, discapacidad física o edad. IOMED acelera la investigación clínica mediante la explotación de textos clínicos a través de NLP. Con este propósito, hemos desarrollado nuestro propio marco de NLP, que integra una serie de modelos para resolver tareas como el reconocimiento y la vinculación con renombradas entidades, la extracción de relaciones, la desambiguación del sentido de las palabras, la clasificación de textos y la clasificación de entidades. Estos algoritmos se encuentran actualmente en ejecución en varios hospitales de España, aplicándose a millones de textos clínicos. Lo que hacemos Hoy en día, alrededor del 50% de los ensayos clínicos se retrasan debido al reclutamiento de pacientes, ya que la recopilación de datos de pacientes se realiza de forma manual. Como resultado, la investigación clínica es altamente ineficiente tanto en tiempo como en costo, por lo que lleva años y miles de millones de dólares desarrollar un nuevo medicamento. Este problema podría resolverse a través de datos del mundo real, es decir, aquellos contenidos en las historias clínicas electrónicas (HCE). Pero desafortunadamente, hasta el 85% de los datos clínicos existentes no están estructurados, es decir, en texto plano. IOMED ha encontrado la solución a esta situación, haciendo posible aprovechar al máximo el valor de los datos clínicos del mundo real. Desarrollamos una herramienta que extrae los datos necesarios de los textos clínicos, lo que da como resultado una base de datos estructurada, estandarizada e interoperable que contiene la información clínica completa de los hospitales. De este modo, la información no reutilizable se transforma en datos disponibles para la Investigación clínica, lo que permite incrementar la cantidad de pacientes que cumplen con los criterios, así como reducir el tiempo total y el trabajo manual dedicado a esta tarea.Hiring InsightsJob activityPosted 30 days ago",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=445e2aa180b48f79&fccid=caad3ea19f83ed97&vjs=3,$800 por mes,Posted 30 days ago,False,"Flextime, ",IOMED,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/IOMED,"Teletrabajo in Barcelona, Barcelona provincia",N/A,Spain,"python, ","postgresql, ","sql, ",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Led by the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction (SRSG), UNDRR has over 100 staff located in its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and in regional offices. Specifically, UNDRR guides, monitors, analyses and reports on progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 - 2030, supports regional and national implementation of the Framework and catalyses action and increases global awareness to reduce disaster risk working with U.N. Member States and a broad range of partners and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, parliamentarians and the science and technology community.   UNDRR helps partners enhance their understanding of the changing nature of risk in order to scale-up and accelerate solutions for resilience. UNDRR aims to accelerate access to risk information across development, humanitarian and fragile state contexts. UNDRR’s Risk Information Exchange (RiX) is a collaborative platform for sharing and innovating in the use of risk information cutting across hazards, vulnerabilities, exposure, and geographies (i.e., global to local).

As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .    Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:  Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020. The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing. According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads. Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America. The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually. Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue. Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.   The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.    And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!

Software Engineer - Python and K8s,"Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase. We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes. This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers. Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role.
