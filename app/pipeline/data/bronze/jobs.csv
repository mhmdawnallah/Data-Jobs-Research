We are currently looking for capable and motivated (post)graduate students who are passionate about emerging topics of artificial intelligence and machine learning to join us for a 1-6 month internship.


About the internship opportunity


Between AI-generated images based on text (with the surge of OpenAI’s DALL-E), and AI-generated video’s supported with deepfakes, AI is making its way into more and more media forms. Could this be used to connect with people when face-to-face interactions are no longer possible? Can the financial sector tame those new techniques and use them to bring value to its customers ? 
Let’s find out together during this internship! We will be studying how AI-generated images and video’s can be used to create hyper personalization of touchpoints where traditional means of communicating fail to do the trick


Who are we looking for?



You are strongly motivated to become an excellent data scientist
You are on-track for a master degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics or related fields.
You are not afraid to get your hands dirty, and your coding skills are on point whether it’s in Java, Python, R, SAS, SPSS etc.
You love picking your brain to apply data science methods to solve business problems
You have strong communication and presentation skills and can’t wait to take full ownership of this project to overcome the stock prediction challenge
You are ready to work independently and collaborate effectively as part of a team of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and Academic Partners.


 
What's in it for you?



You will join a team of passionate experts who deploy cutting-edge AI and analytics solutions, within a leading, global professional services firm
You will join a growing Data Science & Artificial Intelligence practice, moved with an entrepreneurial spirit
You will receive coaching and guidance, both on technical matters and soft skills and project management, and access to state of the art technologies.

 Alludo is looking for an experienced Data Scientist to help us change the way the world works. Here, you’ll facilitate the advancement of our analytical capabilities.

 The top creative and technical minds could work anywhere. So why are so many of them choosing Alludo? Here are three reasons:

 This is the moment. It’s an exciting time at Alludo, with new leadership, a refreshed brand (you probably know us as Corel!), and a whole new approach to changing the way the world works. We’re at the forefront of a movement, and we want you to ride this wave with us.
 We want you to be you. Too often, companies tell you about their culture and then expect you to fit it. Our culture is built from the people who work here. We want you to feel safe to be who you are, take risks, and show us what you’ve got.
 It’s your world. We know you have a life. We want to be part of it, but not all of it. At Alludo, we’re serious about empowering people to work when, how, and where they want. Couch? Sweatpants? Cool with us. We believe that happy employees mean happy customers. That’s why we hire amazing people and get out of their way.

 Sound good so far? Awesome. Let’s talk more about the role and see if we’re destined to be together.  THE ROLE:

 Provide technical design, coding, testing, implementation, maintenance, system, and technical support for BI initiatives
 Be hands-on with ETL to build data pipeline to support automated reporting

 Monitor Dashboard Reporting and Presentation Layer functioning and performance and pro-actively fix issues as found

 YOU:

 3+ years of professional experience
 2+ years of experience working in business intelligence, data analytics, Data engineering or a similar role

 Our Software Engineering Immersive course is a life-changing educational experience where our students learn the skills and mindsets to take on new careers as web developers. We are looking for a lead instructor with strong full-stack web development experience to play a key role in teaching and leading the instructional team.
 Why teach our Software Engineering Immersive?
 If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we’d love for you to consider joining our team. This is also an opportunity to support General Assembly's programs in our newest region in the Middle East, Bahrain! We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As an Instructor Lead for our flagship full-time web development program, you will join us to:

Work closely with one or more co-instructors to guide students through a rigorous, transformational journey towards apprenticeship in software development.
Become a better leader, and mentor as you learn from veteran instructors and our world-class instructional coaches.

Adapt our global curriculum and use it to guide your teaching, building your own lesson plans as needed and contributing back your lessons learned over time.
Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.

What do we teach?
 We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of web development. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or Django or similar frameworks, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.
 We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.
 Skills and Qualifications:

You are the person that your colleagues naturally gravitate to when they are trying to figure something out.
You are eager to shape the skills, minds, and careers of the newest generation of web developers.
You have at least 3+ years of experience working on a software development team.
WDI/SEI Alumni a strong plus.
You have working experience in both front-end and back-end development, and are fluent in:

HTML and CSS
Full-stack JavaScript (strong JavaScript highly preferred)
At least one JS MV* framework (Angular, Backbone, or React preferred)
SQL databases (we generally use PostgreSQL)
NoSQL (we generally cover MongoDB and Redis)
At least one additional object-oriented language (Ruby or Python preferred)


Responsibilities and Duties

Teach Sunday-Thursday, 9am-5pm (local time), for the 12 week duration of the program.
Instructors will need to commit a few hours per week supporting students, preparing lessons and materials, leveraging existing GA curriculum content.
Work closely with co-instructors or teaching assistants to provide students with meaningful and prompt feedback on their progress.
Work alongside GA staff and teaching team to best meet the needs and learning styles of your students.
Guide students through development of a stellar final project that will showcase their abilities to hiring managers.
Facilitate a dynamic, collaborative, and positive classroom community.
Inspire students to persevere through the challenges of learning a new skill set.

General Assembly will cover all travel-related expenses for qualified candidates.

 Unless otherwise noted, remote positions can be performed from the following approved General Assembly operating countries.

Your mission

 Are you ready to join an amazing team, building state-of-the-art OCR scanning applications performing over 10 million scans per year? A team also actively going beyond state-of-the-art by conducting fundamental research in cooperation with renowned research institutes? Then you’ve come to the right place as we are hiring engineers crafting OCR solutions using computer vision and machine learning technologies.
 With your experience you will work on the core computer vision and neural network components for our class leading mobile OCR solution.
 You will develop new algorithms and features, work on prototypes and evaluate which approaches offer the best results. Doing so will involve computer vision, machine learning or a mixture of both.
 Since data makes the world and Anyline go round, data management for training and evaluation of our novel machine learning approaches will be an integral part of your work. To get the data sorted you will collaborate with our dedicated data team - your one stop shop to facilitate your work.

 However, not every challenge can be solved by training a deep network with millions of samples. Sometimes you will need to get creative with traditional 2D image processing approaches as well.
 To round it all off, your new innovative algorithms and trained models need to run close to real time on mobile devices of various performance levels. It’s an interesting and challenging aspect of crafting mobile scanning solutions.
 But wait, there’s more. You’ll even have the opportunity to extend our computer vision ambitions into new and exciting territories beyond our current focus of OCR.

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.
 We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.
 This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.
 Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.
 What you'll do

Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are

You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical
 Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.
 We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.
 We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.
 This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.
 Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.
 What you'll do

Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are

You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

En relevant sommerjobb er gull verdt for deg som ønsker erfaring og muligheten til å sette teori i praksis. Jobb med erfarne Bekk-konsulenter på aktuelle oppdrag, lær masse og vis oss hva du kan – og kanskje leder det til en jobb etter studiene! Sommerjobb i 2023 er fra 13. juni til 28. juli. 




Hvem er du?
 Du studerer datateknikk, informatikk, kybernetikk, matematikk, eller du har en annen relevant utdannelse. Du har et ønske om å få erfaring som data scientist eller data engineer, og interessen for å løse problemer med data bør være en drivkraft for deg. 




Hva skal du gjøre?

 Du vil jobbe i team sammen med andre studenter med sommerjobb og Bekk-konsulenter på et av våre dataoppdrag. Du vil få tett oppfølging av både fadder og teamleder fra Bekk. 
Oppgavene vil være varierte, men handler i sin essens om å omdanne komplekse problemstillinger til spørsmål og hypoteser som kan besvares ved hjelp av data. For å oppnå dette, vil du kunne bidra på flere områder, fra å bygge en robust og skalerbar dataplattform, håndtere lesing, strømming og lagring av data til enkle og avanserte analyser og modeller på toppen av datagrunnlaget.
 Typiske problemstillinger en data scientist / data engineer jobber med er:

Forstå hvilke problemstillinger som er viktigst for kunden
Omsette disse komplekse problemstillinger til hypoteser og spørsmål som kan utforskes med data
Identifisere og innhente egnede datakilder til ulike analyser, med strikk og binders først og robustifisering senere
Utforske data med hensyn på kvalitet, mønstre og egnethet til å benyttes i aktuelle analyser
Modellere og klargjøre data for analyse
Gjennomføre enkle og avanserte analyser
Identifisere og beskrive usikkerhet og svakheter

 - Kommunisere resultater til fag- og forretningsside, i mange tilfeller til brukere som ikke har dyp forståelse av teknologi og data
 I tillegg til å delta på et av våre dataoppdrag vil du også hver uke møte andre sommerjobbere for faglig og sosialt påfyll. Gruppen som arbeider med data vil være på ca 15 personer, så man blir godt kjent med de andre studentene. Vi er opptatt av at du skal ha det gøy, jobbe med spennende oppgaver og trives. Erfaringen vår er at studenter som har hatt sommerjobb i Bekk sitter igjen med et minne for livet og svært relevant erfaring for resten av studiene og veien videre etter utdanning.






Har du spørsmål om stillingen eller er nysgjerrig på hvordan det er å jobbe i Bekk?

About the job
 The Student Researcher Program’s primary objective is to foster academic collaborations with students through research at Google. Join us for a paid Student Researcher position that offers the opportunity to work directly with Google research scientists and engineers on research projects.
 The Student Researcher Program offers more opportunities for research students to work on critical research projects at Google in a less structured way. The program allows for flexibility beyond the limitations of our traditional internship program on aspects such as duration, time commitment, and working location (with options for on-site or remote). 
The topics student researchers work on tend to be open-ended and exploratory, and don't always have a clear deliverable like a traditional internship would.
 Google Research is building the next generation of intelligent systems for all Google products. To achieve this, we’re working on projects that utilize the latest computer science techniques developed by skilled software engineers and research scientists. Google Research teams collaborate closely with other teams across Google, maintaining the flexibility and versatility required to adapt new projects and foci that meet the demands of the world's fast-paced business needs.


 Responsibilities

Participate in research to develop solutions for real-world, large-scale problems.

Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. See also Google's EEO Policy and EEO is the Law.

Data is an incredibly important asset to Lind Capital, and this is your opportunity to join our digital business transformation and help shape the future of our data and support the growth of our company.

 Our Company
 In Lind Capital, we trade the financial markets. We have no external clients. Instead, we trade at our own risk and benefit. Technology and data are essential to our business, and about 1/3 of our 50+ colleagues work directly with tech.

 Your Team
 You will be a part of the team responsible for our company-wide data foundation. The team is anchored in the technology department, which currently consists of 17 Software and Data Engineers. We work closely with our Quantitative Research team, who are the key data consumers. The QR team consists of 4 Data Scientists, working on business-oriented analyses in primarily Python.

 The main tasks of your team are to develop and maintain solutions to collect, process, and manage large amounts of unstructured and structured data to build solutions supporting data-intensive analysis. To take our data management to the next level, we are looking for a new Data Engineer to join our team, and if you are skilled in building solutions to bring raw data into actionable output, you will be able to make a big impact in our organisation.

 We run our data management setup across an in-house developed service and job architecture built in C# and Python, hosted on Docker/Kubernetes, as well as a more classic Data Warehouse architecture on MS SQL server.

 You Make the Difference
 Hard tech skills are required, but personality makes the difference. We strive for a cooperative work environment with a high level of knowledge sharing. A work environment where everybody assumes personal responsibility.

As a Data Engineer you get a deep-dive into clients’ data!
 We hope you are ready to get your hands dirty with designing, building, automating and operating data platforms and data pipelines. It’s all about putting your mind into automating infrastructure, monitoring and recovery routines. Overall, the key is being curious, solving problems and recognising how to interact with different types of data and people. All the work we do is about helping and guiding our clients, so having a true consultant mindset and interest in supporting sales is what we value dearly.
 In our work as consultants we give high fives to agile ways of working and the importance of transparency and trust in teamwork. As a Data Engineer you have talented professionals around you such as data scientists, software developers, designers and of course our clients and their end-users. You will work with a variety of projects, domains and business cases; Lately, we have been working with data architecture of a media company, building a real-time chat spam detector for a gaming company, and making data more accessible on a governmental organization.
 Here are some practical things we’d love to see in your back pocket

 Experience on data stack on AWS (e.g. RedShift, Glue, Athena) or on Azure (e.g. Data Factory, Synapse, Databricks)
 Strong know-how on building, deploying and orchestrating data infrastructure (e.g. serverless computation, Sagemaker, CI tools, Terraform, or similar tools). You have a dev-ops oriented mindset.
 An excellent understanding of databases. Relational databases are most often used, but many projects also employ document databases, key-value stores, and related technologies.
 Practical software experience from a variety of projects. Python or Java experience is on top of our list right now, but other languages are definitely considered as a plus too!
 Appreciation for a good communication with both the team and the clients. You are fluent at least in English and hopefully also in Finnish.

 Does this sound like the opportunity you’ve been looking for? If yes, that’s great news – please head on over to the next phase and submit your application.
 Our application form is about as easy as it gets, just enter your contact information and upload your attachments. We’re hoping to see at least your CV and a few lines about yourself and why you want to join Futurice (for inspiration, to read our tips on how to stand out from the other applicants). You’ll also have the option to submit links to your LinkedIn and/or GitHub profile or your portfolio, as well as share other attachments relevant to the application.
 We will process the applications in the order of their arrival. Those selected for the interview phase can look forward to an initial discussion, both in order for us to get to know you better, and for you to get more familiar with life at Futurice. That will be followed by an in-depth talk with your potential future colleagues to dive deeper into your professional skills, and finally, one more general chat where you’ll discuss things like your potential future projects.
 Working at Futurice

Join us!
 Ready to start the next chapter in your career journey? You’re in the right place. We’re always happy to hear from people who are eager to learn and grow, and share our values. Welcome home.
 As a Data Engineer you get a deep-dive into clients’ data!
 We hope you are ready to get your hands dirty with designing, building, automating and operating data platforms and data pipelines. It’s all about putting your mind into automating infrastructure, monitoring and recovery routines. Overall, the key is being curious, solving problems and recognising how to interact with different types of data and people. All the work we do is about helping and guiding our clients, so having a true consultant mindset and interest in supporting sales is what we value dearly.
 In our work as consultants we give high fives to agile ways of working and the importance of transparency and trust in teamwork. As a Data Engineer you have talented professionals around you such as data scientists, software developers, designers and of course our clients and their end-users. In Sweden this is an emerging area of responsibility and you will be part of shaping the role. Lately in other sites, we have been working with data architecture of a media company, building a real-time chat spam detector for a gaming company, and making data more accessible on a governmental organization. See this as inspiration and future possibilities to what you might be doing together with us!
 Here are some practical things we’d love to see in your back pocket

 Experience on data stack on AWS (e.g. RedShift, Glue, Athena) or on Azure (e.g. Data Factory, Synapse, Databricks)
 Strong know-how on building, deploying and orchestrating data infrastructure (e.g. serverless computation, Sagemaker, CI tools, Terraform, or similar tools). You have a dev-ops oriented mindset.
 An excellent understanding of databases. Relational databases are most often used, but many projects also employ document databases, key-value stores, and related technologies.
 Practical software experience from a variety of projects. Python or Java experience is on top of our list right now, but other languages are definitely considered as a plus too!
 Appreciation for a good communication with both the team and the clients. You are fluent at least in English.

 We offer you the Ultimate Learning Platform
 With us you get the opportunity to work with the most motivated and multi talented forces in development, design and strategy. As an agency, we have a versatile portfolio of projects and we solve different kinds of problems that require different kinds of tools – for you this means the chance of a lifetime to follow your learning goals and broaden your skill set. You will be inspired and supported throughout your journey as our aspiration is to be the Ultimate Learning Platform for your career. We are a people-first-company and believe that at the end of the day happy people are the key to great software and happy clients.
 Does this sound like the opportunity you’ve been looking for? If yes, that’s great news – please head on over to the next phase and submit your application.
 Our application form is about as easy as it gets, just enter your contact information and upload your attachments. We’re hoping to see at least your CV and a few lines about yourself and why you want to join Futurice (for inspiration, to read our tips on how to stand out from the other applicants). You’ll also have the option to submit links to your LinkedIn and/or GitHub profile or your portfolio, as well as share other attachments relevant to the application.
 We will reach out to you after the application period ends. Those selected for the interview phase can look forward to an initial discussion, both in order for us to get to know you better, and for you to get more familiar with life at Futurice. That will be followed by an in-depth talk with your potential future colleagues to dive deeper into your professional skills, and finally, one more general chat where you’ll discuss things like your potential future projects.
 Working at Futurice
 Ever since Futurice was founded, we’ve been committed to offering a workplace people will genuinely enjoy coming to every morning, Mondays included. We’ve put tons of effort into fostering a healthy and welcoming company culture combined with fair and competitive salaries as well as perks that improve the wellbeing of each Futuricean – to learn more, and get to learn some of our people through their career stories. Each of our offices also adds its own unique vibe and flavor into the mix.
 At Futurice, new joiners are not expected to fit into a specific mold – people are free to come as they are, regardless of their background. We believe there’s power in perspectives and consider diversity an important part of our success – which is why we have made diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) a key component of our company’s strategy.
 We’re Futurice

Wat doet een consultant bij Digital Power?
Als consultant in ons team moet je in staat zijn grote hoeveelheden data te verzamelen, te analyseren en te visualiseren. Vervolgens vertaal je de inzichten die je uit de data haalt naar concrete acties voor verschillende stakeholders.Je moet je dus goed inleven in de organisatie van je opdrachtgever: een Manager wil andere informatie zien dan een Data Analist of Developer. Als consultant is het dus belangrijk dat je verschillende ’talen’ spreekt.Tijdens je opdracht verdiep je je steeds verder in de organisatie, stel je actief vragen en luister je goed naar de klant. Zo krijg je het daadwerkelijke vraagstuk boven tafel én ontdek je met wie je kunt samenwerken om het maximale uit je opdracht te halen.
Hoe ziet een typische opdracht eruit?
Het type opdrachten wat je vervult, is afhankelijk van je functieprofiel, de klantvraag en je persoonlijke wensen. Soms heb je één opdracht van 40 uur per week, maar het kan ook zijn dat je je tijd verdeelt over meerdere, verschillende opdrachten tegelijkertijd.De meeste opdrachten vinden plaats op locatie bij de klant. Soms kan het zijn dat je samen met collega’s vanaf ons kantoor aan een opdracht werkt (bijvoorbeeld een dashboard voor een klant). Ook is het mogelijk mee te werken aan interne projecten.Hieronder vind je voorbeelden van opdrachten op het gebied van:

Technical Web Analytics
Data Analytics
Customer Experience
Data Science
Data Engineering

Hoe word ik begeleid in mijn ontwikkeling?
Wanneer je bij ons start, word je gekoppeld aan een buddy. Deze zal jou tijdens je eerste 6 maanden helpen te landen in onze organisatie en je meenemen in onze werkwijze. Je buddy zal je ook begeleiden naar de Gouden Driehoek toe.In de Gouden Driehoek staat jouw ontwikkeling als consultant centraal. Als je al even bij ons in dienst bent, en je directe collega’s leert kennen, dan kan jij je eigen ontwikkeldoelen opstellen. Vanuit de kennis over je collega’s kun je ze vragen je te helpen bij het bereiken van je ontwikkeldoelen. Dat bepaal jij dus zelf. Samen met je begeleiders stel je een persoonlijk ontwikkelingsplan op, specifiek voor jou. Zij zullen je helpen hier invulling en acties in op te nemen en worden hiermee jouw persoonlijke sparringpartner.Onze interne trainingskalender bevat trainingen die je helpen een betere consultant te worden. Een aantal trainingen is ook voor stafmedewerkers relevant.Volg een training R of Python gegeven door een collega of sluit aan bij een interne kennisdeling over Data Engineering. Ontwikkel je daarnaast door trainingen te volgen over onderwerpen als ‘Omgaan met weerstand’, ‘Stakeholdermanagement’, ‘Efficiënter werken’, ‘Presentatievaardigheden’ en ‘Anderen coachen’.Heb je voor je opdracht extra kennis nodig over agile werken? Ook dan kunnen we je helpen. Het is ook mogelijk je SCRUM Master of -Product Owner certificaat te halen.

At EY, you’ll have the chance to build a career as unique as you are, with the global scale, support, inclusive culture and technology to become the best version of you. And we’re counting on your unique voice and perspective to help EY become even better, too. Join us and build an exceptional experience for yourself, and a better working world for all.

 The opportunity As one of the front runners, EY is developing towards a Digital Audit: a data-driven audit in which data analysis is the foundation. The EY Data & Technology Custom Team performs an important role in this development. It has the knowledge, experience, and technology to transform the client’s (financial) data into data analytics products for Audit Teams. With these products they can perform their audit work using the necessary data analyses and have better client conversations. This means the Custom Team is a crucial link in the annual audit cycle.

 The Custom Team is responsible for the entire ETL process: extracting the (financial) data from the client’s systems (Extract), transforming and validating this data in conformity with audit standards (Transform), and finally delivering a high quality data analytics product to the Audit Team (Load). For that we use various external tools, but we also develop our own tools.

 To further its growth, the Custom Team is looking to expand with new Data Engineers (HBO). While we are organized nationally, you will be formally stationed in one of our hubs of your choice (Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Rotterdam, Utrecht, or Zwolle).

 Your key responsibilities As a Data Engineer, you will be working remotely in a team of professionals. This team is responsible for the production and delivery of a specific portfolio of data analytics products from the Helix suite and the development, production and delivery of custom analytics to Audit Teams. You will be primarily working on data transformation to produce data analytics products for the Audit Teams. As a starter in the team you will be focusing on relatively simple productions. As you gain more experience and have shown to possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and ‘audit mindset’, you will be handling more complex productions. Last, and definitely not least, we expect you to be keen on identifying improvements in our team, which can both be procedural and technological. The Custom Team is a relatively new team and is continuously working on improving its processes and tools with a focus on standardization and automation of our process.

 Skills and attributes for success You will need to be pro-active, communicative, and have a drive to understand the client and Audit Team (the ‘business’), because one moment you may be in touch with a client to discuss anomalies in the received data, while another moment you are discussing opportunities for a new custom analytic to support the Audit Team.

 To qualify for the role you must have:

 A Bachelor’s degree in one of the following fields: Computer Science, Business Analytics, Information Management, Econometrics, or another technical/quantitative field;
 Demonstrable experience working with Python and/or SQL to transform and load data (or comparable);
 Experience with visualization tools like PowerBI, Spotfire, or Tableau;
 High communication skills (both orally and in writing) in English; and
 A client-focused mindset and be able to work in a multi-disciplinary team.


 Responsibilities, Qualifications, Certifications - External
 Ideally, you’ll also have:

 Knowledge of finance (e.g. Business or Accountancy);
 Knowledge of one or more ERP systems (e.g. SAP, Exact, AFAS); or
 The ability to speak Dutch


 What we look for Our ideal candidate has a critical mindset and an eye for detail: an ‘audit attitude’. In addition, you have a great sense of responsibility, as Audit Teams need to trust that the data analytics products you deliver are valid.

 What we offer We offer a competitive remuneration package where you’ll be rewarded for your individual and team performance. Our comprehensive Total Rewards package includes support for flexible working and career development. At EY, your competencies and your areas of interest will determine your future, plus we offer you:

 Continuous learning: You’ll develop the mindset and skills to navigate whatever comes next.
 Success as defined by you: We’ll provide the tools and flexibility, so you can make a meaningful impact, your way.
 Diverse and inclusive culture: You’ll be embraced for who you are and empowered to use your voice to help others find theirs.

 The exceptional EY experience. It’s yours to build.

 EY | Building a better working world

 EY exists to build a better working world, helping to create long-term value for clients, people and society and build trust in the capital markets.
 Enabled by data and technology, diverse EY teams in over 150 countries provide trust through assurance and help clients grow, transform and operate.
 Working across assurance, consulting, law, strategy, tax and transactions, EY teams ask better questions to find new answers for the complex issues facing our world today.

 An (online) assessment and a pre employment screening are part of the application procedure. Due to laws and regulations, and because EY (and in some cases its clients) has high demands on the reliability and integrity of its employees, every new employee will be screened. Depending on your rank the pre-employment screening could contain the following: Certificate of Conduct (in Dutch: VOG) or - if requesting a Dutch VOG is not possible - Criminal Background Check of the country you are currently living or have lived during the last five years, integrity questionnaire, verification of ID, diplomas and/or work experience and consultation of the Dutch insolvency registry.
