Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.
 We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

 This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.
 Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.
 What you'll do

Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are

You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical
 Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.
 We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.

 We are looking for instructors
 Our Software Engineering Immersive course is a life-changing educational experience where our students learn the skills and mindsets to take on new careers as web developers. We are looking for a lead instructor with strong full-stack web development experience to play a key role in teaching and leading the instructional team.
 Why teach our Software Engineering Immersive?
 If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we’d love for you to consider joining our team. This is also an opportunity to support General Assembly's programs in our newest region in the Middle East, Bahrain! We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love. As an Instructor Lead for our flagship full-time web development program, you will join us to:

Work closely with one or more co-instructors to guide students through a rigorous, transformational journey towards apprenticeship in software development.
Become a better leader, and mentor as you learn from veteran instructors and our world-class instructional coaches.
Inspire and support students as they identify their passions and drive their own continued learning beyond the curriculum.
Adapt our global curriculum and use it to guide your teaching, building your own lesson plans as needed and contributing back your lessons learned over time.
Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.

What do we teach?
 We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript. In general, our curriculum is scaffolded to follow the historical evolution of web development. We start by teaching the fundamentals of programming and web design through JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or Django or similar frameworks, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.
 We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.
 Skills and Qualifications:

You are the person that your colleagues naturally gravitate to when they are trying to figure something out.
You are eager to shape the skills, minds, and careers of the newest generation of web developers.
You have at least 3+ years of experience working on a software development team.
WDI/SEI Alumni a strong plus.
You have working experience in both front-end and back-end development, and are fluent in:

HTML and CSS
Full-stack JavaScript (strong JavaScript highly preferred)
At least one JS MV* framework (Angular, Backbone, or React preferred)
SQL databases (we generally use PostgreSQL)
NoSQL (we generally cover MongoDB and Redis)
At least one additional object-oriented language (Ruby or Python preferred)


Responsibilities and Duties

Teach Sunday-Thursday, 9am-5pm (local time), for the 12 week duration of the program.
Instructors will need to commit a few hours per week supporting students, preparing lessons and materials, leveraging existing GA curriculum content.
Work closely with co-instructors or teaching assistants to provide students with meaningful and prompt feedback on their progress.
Work alongside GA staff and teaching team to best meet the needs and learning styles of your students.
Guide students through development of a stellar final project that will showcase their abilities to hiring managers.
Facilitate a dynamic, collaborative, and positive classroom community.
Inspire students to persevere through the challenges of learning a new skill set.

General Assembly will cover all travel-related expenses for qualified candidates.

 Unless otherwise noted, remote positions can be performed from the following approved General Assembly operating countries.
 United States of America (states of operation may vary), Canada (provinces of operation may vary), United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore.

Uren: 32-40 uur
 Werkplek: Standplaats Utrecht, maar projecten door heel het land!
 Ervaring: Traineeship

 Heb jij passie voor werken met data en ben je klaar voor een knallende start van je carrière? Als Data Engineer trainee zet je je tanden stevig in de techniek om grote hoeveelheden data te prepareren en op te slaan. Uiteraard doe je dat niet alleen, maar werk je in een team van IT-professionals met elk zijn/haar eigen expertise. Als gemotiveerde Data Engineer draag jij bij door data te prepareren, waardoor de klant beter gebruik kan maken van zijn data. Je ontwikkelt streaming en/of batch processen om data te ontsluiten en bouwt mee aan het datalandschap en de implementatie van Cloud oplossingen (AWS). Daarnaast ben je samen met je team verantwoordelijk voor het opleveren van kwalitatief hoogwaardige oplossingen. Je ontwikkelt jezelf gedurende dit Traineeship tot een zelfstandig werkende professional, die er energie van krijgt om ‘slimme’ oplossingen te creëren en te adviseren.









Jouw job in één alinea









Natuurlijk gooien wij jou niet meteen in het diepe. Je volgt diverse trainingen om je professionele skill set uit te breiden met certificaten in bijvoorbeeld Business Intelligence tools zoals SQL, Data Modelling, Data Analytics, Data Visualisation en Business Analysis. Daarnaast trainen we je in handige consultancy vaardigheden zoals storytelling en overtuigend presenteren. Laat ons weten wat jou motiveert en waar jouw ambities liggen. Wij helpen je daar graag bij. Je krijgt bij ons namelijk alle ruimte om je eigen carrière vorm te geven en de opleidingen te volgen die daarbij passen. Ook na dit Traineeship heb je keuze uit honderden opleidingen en trainingen via het All You Can Train-programma van onze Capgemini Academy. Zo kun je jezelf verder blijven ontwikkelen tot IT-professional binnen jouw vakgebied!









Je thuisbasis bij Capgemini









Capgemini is een van de grootste IT-consultancy bedrijven in Nederland en is marktleider op het gebied van Consulting, Technology en Outsourcing. Bij ons heb je alle mogelijkheden van een groot bedrijf, maar de bescheidenheid en sfeer die je bij een klein bedrijf verwacht. We werken op basis van vertrouwen en bieden je de vrijheid om jezelf te ontwikkelen. Natuurlijk werken we hard, maar we vinden een fijne werksfeer en collegialiteit onderling ook erg belangrijk.
 Onze personeelsvereniging Escape en onze Young Professional community IDentity organiseren regelmatig verschillende toffe activiteiten. Denk aan borrels, vrijmibo en leuke teamuitjes. Genoeg te doen dus! Wat je daarnaast nog meer kunt verwachten?









Benefits










Een salaris van € 3.477,- inclusief mobiliteitsvergoeding van 750 euro & 8% vakantiegeld.
 De eerste 1,5 jaar twee keer kans op een salarisverhoging.
 Cold feet? Kennen we niet. Bij ons krijg je direct een vast contract.
 All You Can Train zonder enige verplichtingen.
 Een goed gevulde koffer met vakantiegeld én genoeg tijd (26 vakantiedagen) om het uit te geven.
 Een premievrij pensioen.
 Werk waar je maar wilt op een device naar keuze met onze connectiviteitsvergoeding.
 Je eerste levensbehoefte als professional: een snelle laptop en een simkaart die je ook privé mag gebruiken.
 Altijd lekker onderweg met je leaseauto of NS-businesscard. Of kies voor uitbetaling van je reiskostenvergoeding.










      Alles over onze arbeidsvoorwaarden 
     









Waarom past deze vacature bij jou?









Je bent een enthousiaste Young Professional die zich wil specialiseren in (technische) data-vraagstukken bij grote (internationale) organisaties. Naast sterke analytische skills en praktische vaardigheden, bezit je ook over een dosis creativiteit en ben je klantgericht. Flexibiliteit is voor jou geen issue en het lijkt je leuk om bij onze opdrachtgever op locatie aan projecten te werken.
 Daarnaast heb je:

 Een afgeronde HBO- of WO-opleiding in een IT-studierichting.
 Maximaal 0-2 jaar werkervaring.
 Aantoonbare ervaring met programmeren.
 Ervaring met AWS, Python en Java is een pré.
 Je hebt tijdens je opleiding gewerkt met (grote) databestanden, simulatie onderzoek en/of databases.
 Een uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal.












Werken bij Capgemini 




        Get the future you want. Die belofte doen wij aan jou. Dat begint al op dag één. Met een goede onboarding en gestructureerde en transparante groeipaden. Maar ook: volop mogelijkheden om daarvan af te wijken, zelf te pionieren en je eigen weg te kiezen. Daarbij kun je van onze kant rekenen op grenzeloos vertrouwen én collegiale support. Werken bij Capgemini betekent ook werken in het internationale hart van de innovatie. De eredivisie van de technologie. Een werkgever met oog voor jou en het vizier op de toekomst, waarin duurzaamheid en diversiteit en inclusie de hoofdrollen spelen.

Wil jij als IT Business Consultant meebouwen aan de digitalisering van de slimste haven van de wereld? Wil jij je verder blijven ontwikkelen in een uitdagende en veranderende omgeving? Beschik je over enthousiasme, goede expertise, people skills én organisatiekracht? Havenbedrijf Rotterdam zoekt een medior IT Business Consultant die het belangrijk vindt zich zowel inhoudelijk als persoonlijk te ontwikkelen en daar binnen de haven van Rotterdam alle kans voor ziet.



 Afdelingsinformatie
 Binnen de afdeling Digital & Information Technology faciliteert team Digitalisering Havenontwikkeling en -Beheer (DHOB) de digitalisering van het operationele domein van het havenbedrijf. Bijvoorbeeld werkzaamheden rondom de ontwikkeling, bouw, beheer en gebruik van assets (kademuren, viaducten, wegen, ligplaatsen etc.) in en de ontwikkeling van het havengebied. Ook de (toekomstige) invulling van de gebruiksruimte in het havengebied is een wezenlijk onderdeel van ons werk. Het team DHOB is integraal verantwoordelijk voor de ontwikkeling en het beheer van het applicatieportfolio van het operationele domein. Vanuit onze technische en functionele kennis zijn wij de drijvende krachten achter innovatie en doorontwikkeling. Belangrijke onderwerpen in ons domein zijn IoT, GIS, BIM/CAD en EAM. Wij zien een grote uitdaging in de bedrijfsbrede ambitie om datagedreven te werken en te kunnen werken. Met onze partners in het werkveld én met alle collega’s binnen het havenbedrijf.


 Wat ga je doen?
 Als IT Business consultant ben je voortdurend in gesprek met eindgebruikers in ons domein. Hierbij doe je meerdere dingen. Zo biedt je inzichten in de innovatieve mogelijkheden van digitalisering.

Je levert dus een voortdurende bijdrage aan de digitalisering van het operationele werk van het Havenbedrijf. Bij de mogelijke ontwikkelingen en oplossingen ben je in staat om de uitdaging te benaderen vanuit gebruikersoogpunt, maar ook vanuit de eisen van beheer.  Je komt te werken in een breed team van IT-collega’s zoals projectmanagers, business consultants, Security en Servicemanagement specialisten. Wij werken samen met de gebruikers (bijvoorbeeld asset managers, port engineers en data scientists) in ons operationele domein. Samen met deze gebruikers worden de juiste ontwikkelingen geprioriteerd en beheerswerkzaamheden uitgevoerd.


 Wat vragen wij van jou?

 Je hebt een afgeronde HBO of WO opleiding in bedrijfskunde, bedrijfskundige informatica of vergelijkbare opleiding.
 Je hebt de drive om continu verbeteringen door te voeren en je denkt in termen van ‘business waarde’.
 Je hebt ervaring met projectmatig werken (sturen op planning, budgetten, resourcing) en het bereiken van doelen.
 Je bent niet alleen in staat om de wens van de gebruiker te vertalen naar een toekomstgerichte oplossing, maar ook om de gebruiker mee te nemen in de laatste (innovatieve) ontwikkelingen rondom zijn/haar vraag.
 Je kunt met overtuigingskracht complexe materie in eenvoudige bewoordingen uitleggen.
 Je bent gewend om zowel in Agile/Scrum als PRINCE II projecten te werken op het snijvlak van IT en bedrijfsvoering.
 Je hebt ervaring met de transitie van een niet-geïntegreerde applicatieportfolio naar een geïntegreerd portfolio van platformtechnieken en dataflows. Deze ervaring is bij voorkeur vanuit een functioneel, bedrijfskundig perspectief
 Je hebt ervaring met dataplatformen voor sensoren, assets en geografische informatie, en digitalisering in een veelzijdige omgeving.
 Je kent de kracht van data- en requirements management.
 Je werkt zelfstandig, proactief en vind je eigen weg in de organisatie.
 Uiteraard is van belang dat je je wilt blijven ontwikkelen in je functie en op de hoogte bent en blijft van alle relevante ontwikkelingen op het gebied van havens en technologie.
 Heb je ervaring in: 
   
Het werken met IoT (platform en architectuur).
 GIS technologie.
 Het samenwerken in het werkveld van Asset Management.
 Je bent bekend met Value Driven Maintenance en Asset Performance Management.
 Het werken met BIM en OTL

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.
 We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.

Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.
 Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.
 What you'll do

Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are

You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an excellent Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical
 Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations.

En relevant sommerjobb er gull verdt for deg som ønsker erfaring og muligheten til å sette teori i praksis. Jobb med erfarne Bekk-konsulenter på aktuelle oppdrag, lær masse og vis oss hva du kan – og kanskje leder det til en jobb etter studiene! Sommerjobb i 2023 er fra 13. juni til 28. juli. 




Hvem er du?
 Du studerer datateknikk, informatikk, kybernetikk, matematikk, eller du har en annen relevant utdannelse. Du har et ønske om å få erfaring som data scientist eller data engineer, og interessen for å løse problemer med data bør være en drivkraft for deg. 




Hva skal du gjøre?

 Du vil jobbe i team sammen med andre studenter med sommerjobb og Bekk-konsulenter på et av våre dataoppdrag. Du vil få tett oppfølging av både fadder og teamleder fra Bekk. 
Oppgavene vil være varierte, men handler i sin essens om å omdanne komplekse problemstillinger til spørsmål og hypoteser som kan besvares ved hjelp av data. For å oppnå dette, vil du kunne bidra på flere områder, fra å bygge en robust og skalerbar dataplattform, håndtere lesing, strømming og lagring av data til enkle og avanserte analyser og modeller på toppen av datagrunnlaget.
 Typiske problemstillinger en data scientist / data engineer jobber med er:

Forstå hvilke problemstillinger som er viktigst for kunden
Omsette disse komplekse problemstillinger til hypoteser og spørsmål som kan utforskes med data
Identifisere og innhente egnede datakilder til ulike analyser, med strikk og binders først og robustifisering senere
Utforske data med hensyn på kvalitet, mønstre og egnethet til å benyttes i aktuelle analyser
Modellere og klargjøre data for analyse
Gjennomføre enkle og avanserte analyser
Identifisere og beskrive usikkerhet og svakheter

 - Kommunisere resultater til fag- og forretningsside, i mange tilfeller til brukere som ikke har dyp forståelse av teknologi og data
 I tillegg til å delta på et av våre dataoppdrag vil du også hver uke møte andre sommerjobbere for faglig og sosialt påfyll. Gruppen som arbeider med data vil være på ca 15 personer, så man blir godt kjent med de andre studentene. Vi er opptatt av at du skal ha det gøy, jobbe med spennende oppgaver og trives. Erfaringen vår er at studenter som har hatt sommerjobb i Bekk sitter igjen med et minne for livet og svært relevant erfaring for resten av studiene og veien videre etter utdanning.






Har du spørsmål om stillingen eller er nysgjerrig på hvordan det er å jobbe i Bekk?

Jij hebt lef! Je durft kritisch te zijn tegen onze klanten. Je helpt de klant écht een stap verder. Je denkt mee, stelt vragen en geeft een weerwoord als je een andere mening of ervaring hebt.
We zijn open en eerlijk naar elkaar en naar onze klanten. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat. Van jou verwachten we:

All the work we do is about helping and guiding our clients, so having a true consultant mindset and interest in supporting sales is what we value dearly.
 In our work as consultants we give high fives to agile ways of working and the importance of transparency and trust in teamwork. As a Data Engineer you have talented professionals around you such as data scientists, software developers, designers and of course our clients and their end-users. You will work with a variety of projects, domains and business cases; Lately, we have been working with data architecture of a media company, building a real-time chat spam detector for a gaming company, and making data more accessible on a governmental organization.
 Here are some practical things we’d love to see in your back pocket

 Experience on data stack on AWS (e.g. RedShift, Glue, Athena) or on Azure (e.g. Data Factory, Synapse, Databricks)
 Strong know-how on building, deploying and orchestrating data infrastructure (e.g. serverless computation, Sagemaker, CI tools, Terraform, or similar tools). You have a dev-ops oriented mindset.
 An excellent understanding of databases. Relational databases are most often used, but many projects also employ document databases, key-value stores, and related technologies.
 Practical software experience from a variety of projects. Python or Java experience is on top of our list right now, but other languages are definitely considered as a plus too!
 Appreciation for a good communication with both the team and the clients. You are fluent at least in English and hopefully also in Finnish.

 Does this sound like the opportunity you’ve been looking for? If yes, that’s great news – please head on over to the next phase and submit your application.
 Our application form is about as easy as it gets, just enter your contact information and upload your attachments. We’re hoping to see at least your CV and a few lines about yourself and why you want to join Futurice (for inspiration, to read our tips on how to stand out from the other applicants). You’ll also have the option to submit links to your LinkedIn and/or GitHub profile or your portfolio, as well as share other attachments relevant to the application.
 We will process the applications in the order of their arrival. Those selected for the interview phase can look forward to an initial discussion, both in order for us to get to know you better, and for you to get more familiar with life at Futurice. That will be followed by an in-depth talk with your potential future colleagues to dive deeper into your professional skills, and finally, one more general chat where you’ll discuss things like your potential future projects.
 Working at Futurice
 Ever since Futurice was founded, we’ve been committed to offering a workplace people will genuinely enjoy coming to every morning, Mondays included. We’ve put tons of effort into fostering a healthy and welcoming company culture combined with fair and competitive salaries as well as perks that improve the wellbeing of each Futuricean – to learn more, and get to learn some of our people through their career stories. Each of our offices also adds its own unique vibe and flavor into the mix.
 At Futurice, new joiners are not expected to fit into a specific mold – people are free to come as they are, regardless of their background. We believe there’s power in perspectives and consider diversity an important part of our success – which is why we have made diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) a key component of our company’s strategy.

    We are expanding our team of QA engineers and looking for people who will fit into our group. Kontent.ai is a large enterprise product, there is a 
    lot of diverse work going on, and therefore we don't have an exact definition of the ideal candidate. We would definitely welcome someone who notices a typo or a weird font when reading a poster, enjoys looking for shortcuts and bugs when playing games, or enjoys connecting the dots in a pile of seemingly unrelated information.
   

 We are increasing the percentage of fully automated tests, so you should know at least one 
    object-oriented language or have basic experience with 
    Typescript and React.
   

     There's 
    something for everyone. For those who are drawn to the front-end, but also those who prefer to code some scripts.
   

     You can work with frameworks like:
   

Selenium
Playwright
NUnit
XUnit

Write JavaScript UI tests in Playwright, try out C# and run UI tests against Selenium grid, innovate and create testing tools, or write a completely new type of test that will make our development process more effective. You can take a tour of exploratory testing when working on a new product feature or follow testing instructions when reproducing a bug.

 We take testing seriously; every commit to our master branch triggers thousands of tests, which are 
    run on temporary environments in Azure. Good automated tests with execution history combined with manual testing make our release process faster, development easier, and product more stable.
   

     Want to know more? Contact us and meet online or in our Brno offices.
