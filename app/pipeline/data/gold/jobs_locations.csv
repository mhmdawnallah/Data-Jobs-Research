24,f140fa94424b835a,Experienced Data Engineer,https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=f140fa94424b835a,20221112,suomi,False,Solita,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Solita,"

Solita Finland Connected Data unit consists of more than 300 data and integration experts. With our growth, we are looking for experienced Data Engineers to work on projects in different industries.
 What would it be like?
 Data Engineers work together with Solita team in various customer projects, where, for example, data platforms and various data utilisation solutions are built, data storage is modernised and data obtained from IoT sources is processed.
 You have the possibility to influence what kind of project you want to work on. At best, the project includes learning something new, the possibility to use your existing skills, and creating content that is meaningful to you. In addition, working can (and even should) be fun.
 What else do we offer?
 We offer the muscles of a big company, but the culture of a small company. In practice it means:

A caring culture where you and your 1500 Solita colleagues are always at the centre of management not only as a group but as individuals too
Connected Data community consisting of more than 500 data professionals internationally, from whom you can get help for any problem you might have
Teamwork methods because we work as a team in projects
Appropriate workload so that there is time for other important things in life than work too
Freedom and responsibility – you can do your work wherever you want (at our offices, remotely in Finland, sometimes also at the customer's premises)
 Opportunities to develop your skills in everyday project work, as well as support in developing your own career path, for example from one role to another (eg. from Data Engineer to Data Architect)

What tools are we using?
 At the core of the data creation is, of course, data processing; loading, parsing, saving, modelling, and storing. The tools are selected for each project as needed:

Almost all of our new data projects are done in the cloud. Our options are AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Do you already know one or more of these?
Databases create the basis for all data creation. We mostly work with databases that use SQL.
Python and other programming languages are actively used, for example, in the construction of data pipes. If you know how to program, you have more options when it comes to our client projects.
We want to use modern modelling methods such as Data Vault 2.0.

We expect technological know-how from an experienced Data Engineer, but you don't have to know everything. You get to learn new technologies with us. In addition to tech know-how, we value experience in project work and consulting in the customer interface, as well as the desire to grow your own know-how along with the ever-developing IT industry.
 What is Solita like as an employer?
 Solita is an IT consulting company with Finnish roots, and we also have offices in Europe. Our consultants work with Finnish and international projects.
 In addition to Data Engineers, we also have top professionals in data science, data visualisation, and master data, as well as a group of experienced data architects. With our work, we strive to create sustainable solutions – ones that we ourselves would like to use and maintain.
 Our values are caring, easy-going, courage and passion. Our employees have chosen those themselves, and maybe that's why we can see and feel value-based actions every day. Here are a few examples:

Caring: Our culture has been created in a way that you can easily get support in project challenges from the entire work community, not just from your own project team
Easy-going: Even though we are already quite a large company, the atmosphere is cosy and relaxed, and the hierarchy is low.
Courage: We build genuine partnerships with our customers. This sometimes requires courage to disagree with the customer and say it out loud as well.
Passion: At Solita, work is done with great passion, but having fun at the same time. We pride ourselves on the quality of our work.

Let's talk?
 Let's find out together whether we could find the next challenge in your career with Solita! Our recruitment process includes two interviews, mainly in Teams.
 Send us your CV, a link to your LinkedIn profile and/or write an application letter. We will be in touch with you soon.

Haemme Cloud Data Engineer -osaajia Accenture Data & AI -yksikköön, jossa sinulla on mahdollisuus työskennellä samanhenkisten ja inspiroivien kollegoiden kanssa käyttäen uusimpia teknologioita.

 Meille Cloud Data Engineer tarkoittaa pilvipohjaisten ratkaisuiden ohjelmistokehittäjää, jolla on vahva datapainotus. Tehtävänäsi on auttaa osana tiimiä asiakkaitamme toteuttamaan datan välittämiseen, tallentamiseen, prosessointiin ja tarjoamiseen liittyviä ratkaisuja, kuten esimerkiksi

 IoT-laitteiden datavirtojen välittämistä IoT-laitteiden ja pilviympäristöjen kesken
 Sovellusten tuottamien datavirtojen välittämistä dataa hyödyntäville ja analysoiville sovelluksille
 Datan siirtämistä on-premise-ratkaisuista pilvipalveluihin
 Erilaisia datan tallennusratkaisuja ja tietojen siirtoa tallennustapojen välillä
 Datan siirtämistä ja peilausta pilvialustojen välillä
 Datan muokkaamista, rikastamista, suodattamista, analysointia ja reagointia osana datan välitystä


 Datan hyödyntäminen edellyttää, että data on tarjolla oikeassa paikassa, oikeassa formaatissa, oikea-aikaisesti ja sisällöltään oikeana. Ilman luotettavaa ja tehokasta datan välittämistä niin inhimillinen kuin automatisoitukin päätöksenteko perustuu väärille tai vanhentuneille tiedoille. Cloud data engineer on kriittisessä roolissa mahdollistamaan yrityksen tai organisaation kehittyminen toimimaan aidosti dataperusteisesti.

 Cloud Data Engineer -roolissa toimit osana Accenturen globaalin Data & AI -yksikön pohjoismaista ryhmää. Asemapaikkasi on Suomi ja asiakkaasi johtavia pohjoismaisia yrityksiä ja organisaatioita.



Toivomme sinulta

 Korkeakoulututkintoa
 Ymmärrystä ja kiinnostusta dataan ja sen välitysratkaisuiden kehittämiseen aina ratkaisun suunnittelusta laadun varmistamiseen ja tuotantoon asti
 Hands-on koodaus- ja sovelluskehityskokemusta esimerkiksi SQL, Python, Java, Node.js
 Mielellään vähintään yhtä AWS, GCP tai Azure -sertifikaattia
 Kokemusta ja/tai vahvaa kiinnostusta virtaavan datan (data streaming) käsittelyyn liittyvistä teknologioista, kuten Apache Kafka, Apache Flink tai vastaavat
 Kokemusta ja/tai vahvaa kiinnostusta eräpohjaiseen datan käsittelyyn liittyvistä teknologioista, kuten Apache Spark, Apache Airflow tai vastaavat.
 Kokemusta relaatiokannoista ja NoSQL-kannoista
 Kokemusta ja/tai kiinnostusta dataintegraatiotuotteista, kuten Matillion, SnapLogic, Talend tai vastaavat
 Tietojärjestelmäkehityksen perusvalmiuksia, kuten versionhallinnan (Git) käyttämistä tiimin jäsenenä, dokumentointitaitoja, testausosaamista ja agile-pohjaisen tiimin roolien ja käytäntöjen ymmärtämistä
 Vahvaa valmiutta ja intoa oppia sekä kehittää omia taitoja.
 Kekseliäisyyttä ja herkkyyttä tunnistaa ratkaisuja ja olla yhteistyökykyinen ongelmanratkaisija
 Sujuvaa englannin ja suomen kielen taitoa (muut pohjoismaiden kielet katsotaan eduksi)


 Jos edellä mainittujen lisäksi tai sijasta suurin kiinnostuksesi ja osaamisesi kohdistuu enemmän data-alustojen DevOps ja IaC -kyvykkyyksiin, niin kannattaa harkita myös Cloud Data Platform Engineer -roolia.

Over 100,000 businesses and millions of people use 1Password to protect their most important information, and we believe those people – and the companies they work for – shouldn’t have to choose between security and productivity. We see security as a human challenge, rather than a technological one. It’s hard work, but our mission has always been to ease the tension between security and convenience and help people navigate the digital world without fear or friction. Human-centric security is part of our DNA, but human-centricity is also the backbone of our culture.

You will work closely with leaders across product, sales, and marketing to support and implement high-quality, data-driven decisions.

 Strong SQL skills, ability to perform effective querying involving multiple tables and subqueries.
 2+ years of experience working on data warehouse automation using DBT to manage DAGs of 1000+ nodes.
 Understanding of and experience using analytical concepts and statistical techniques: hypothesis development, designing tests/experiments, analyzing data, drawing conclusions, and developing actionable recommendations for business units.
 Experience and knowledge of statistical modeling techniques: (e.g. linear & multivariate regression, classification, time series forecasting, etc.).
 Experience using analytics techniques to contribute to company growth efforts, increasing revenue and other key business outcomes.
 Strong problem solving, quantitative and analytical abilities.
 Strong ability to plan and manage numerous processes, people and projects simultaneously.
 Excellent communication, collaboration and delegation skills.
 We're looking for someone with at least 5 years of experience in a position monitoring, managing, manipulating and drawing insights from data, and someone with at least 3 years of experience leading a team. The right candidate will also be proficient and experienced with the following tools/programs: data visualization tools (we use Looker!), various web analytics tools (we use Google Analytics!), and, ideally, Python.

 What you can expect:

 Lead cross-functional projects using advanced data modeling and analysis techniques to discover insights that will guide strategic decisions and uncover optimization opportunities.
 Build, develop and maintain data models, reporting systems, data automation systems, dashboards and performance metrics support that support key business decisions.

 Communicate results and business impacts of insight initiatives to stakeholders

 Anticipate future demands of initiatives related to people, technology, budget and business within your department and design/implement solutions to meet these needs.


 Even if you don't tick all those boxes, we'd like to hear from you. 




  The most important thing you can bring to this job is the drive to dive in, get the work done, and fix root causes instead of treating symptoms. We believe in continuous learning and support professional development on the job with a budget to back it up. If you bring a desire to do the right thing for our customers, a sense of ownership over the product you work on, and a focus on shipping quality code, we want to hear from you.

Haemme Data Platform Engineer -osaajia Accenture Data & AI -yksikköön, jossa sinulla on mahdollisuus työskennellä samanhenkisten ja inspiroivien kollegoiden kanssa käyttäen uusimpia teknologioita.

 Meille Data Platform Engineer tarkoittaa devops-kehittäjän ja sovelluskehittäjän yhdistelmää, jolla on vahva datapainotus. Tehtävänäsi on auttaa asiakkaitamme kehittämään korkealaatuisia pilvipohjaisia data-alustoja ja niihin liittyviä DevOps ja IaC -kyvykkyyksiä.

Lisäsi tuet muuta tiimiä DevOps-ratkaisuiden käyttämisessä. Työnäsi on mahdollistaa ja nopeuttaa dataintensiivisten sovellusten kehittämistä. Tarvittaessa sinulla on myös itselläsi kyky toteuttaa dataintensiivisiä sovelluksia data-alustaan hyödyntäen. Työssäsi hyödynnät tarjolla olevia pilvipalveluita (Azure, AWS, GCP).

 Datan hyödyntäminen edellyttää, että data on tarjolla oikeassa paikassa, oikeassa formaatissa, oikea-aikaisesti ja sisällöltään oikeana. Ilman luotettavaa ja tehokasta datan välittämistä niin inhimillinen kuin automatisoitukin päätöksenteko perustuu väärille tai vanhentuneille tiedoille. Data Platform Engineer on kriittisessä roolissa luomaan sellaisia datan siirron ja käsittelyn alustaratkaisuja ja kehityskäytäntöjä, jotka mahdollistavat luotettavien ja tehokkaiden dataintensiivisten sovellusten aikaansaamisen.

 Data Platform Engineer -roolissa toimit osana Accenturen globaalin Data & AI -yksikön pohjoismaista ryhmää. Asemapaikkasi on Suomi ja asiakkaasi johtavia pohjoismaisia yrityksiä ja organisaatioita.

Vil du specialisere dig i data science, AI og innovative dataløsninger? Så er du måske én af vores kommende graduates. Som graduate i PFA får du et skræddersyet forløb, der kickstarter din karriere som specialist eller leder med stor personlig og faglig udvikling.




Du bliver omgivet af de vildeste AI specialister


   Som AI & Data graduate bliver du en del af teamet AI Technology & Platform. Vi er ni i dit team, der også en del af PFA’s AI- og data-community. Her er vi samlet mere end 30 specialister fordelt på tre teams, der arbejder tæt sammen. Du er dermed i de bedste omgivelser til at opnå en bred erfaring og lære best practice indenfor data science og engineering. Du skal være med til at udvikle intelligente, automatiserede og skalerbare løsninger til PFA’s kunder og rådgivere, på tværs af de digitale kanaler – og baseret på innovativ brug af data. Vi har aktuelt fokus på PFA’s produkter inden for rådgivning, forebyggelse og sundhed, hvor der sker en masse spændende udvikling. Som AI & Data graduate er du under hele forløbet en del af samme team med én leder, men dine opgaver dækker hele AI & Data værdikæden i krydsfeltet mellem de tre teams - fra idé og koncept til data engineering, udvikling af algoritmer, produktionssætning og platformsudvikling.
  



   Som AI & Data graduate skal du:
   


være en del af PFA’s AI- og data-community og befinde dig i spændingsfeltet mellem data engineering, data science, machine learning, softwareudvikling, DevOps og CloudOps
opbygge en bred dataprofil 
være med til at udvikle produkter end-to-end
forstå forretningsbehov og oversætte dem til data- og teknologidrevne løsninger 
lære alt om et dataprodukts livscyklus – fra fødsel til drift.





”Vi går efter at finde en graduate der – ligesom os – er passioneret for data science og for at skabe nye løsninger og mærkbar forskel for de mange kunder, der besøger vores digitale platforme, og for vores kollegaer i PFA. Du får masser af plads til at bruge din analytiske sans og din nysgerrighed i et kreativt og spændende community, hvor vi arbejder på kanten af den nyeste teknologi og har end-to-end-kapabilitet fra forretningsidé til produktionssætning i it-systemerne,” siger Johannes Eichler Waage, der er leder af AI Technology & Platform i PFA.
  



To år med accelereret faglig og personlig udvikling


   Som graduate i PFA bliver du en del af et tæt fællesskab med andre graduates, så du opbygger netværk og udveksler erfaringer. Du er på bootcamps, hvor du optimerer din professionelle værktøjskasse med træning i bl.a. problemløsning, innovation og facilitering. Du er også i netværk, der fokuserer på din personlige udvikling, og gennem hele graduate programmet er du tilknyttet en mentor, der sparrer med dig og støtter dig.
  



   Graduates er PFA’s bud på fremtiden, og derfor bliver du hurtigt en attraktiv kollega på alle niveauer i huset. Du bliver fastansat og som udgangspunktet tilknyttet én forretningsenhed gennem hele forløbet på 24 måneder. Programmet er designet til, at du udvikler dig både fagligt og personligt i høj fart.
  



Kan du se dig selv?


   Som graduate i PFA skal du have en kandidatgrad, og det er sikkert 1-2 år siden, du dimitterede. Du mener, at PFA’s kundeejede struktur og samfundsansvarlige agenda er helt rigtig. Du trives med at arbejde med komplekse problemstillinger og forvandle dem til innovative løsninger, og du har evner, vilje og interesse for at blive klogere - og for at spille dine kollegaer gode. Du:
  



er – eller bliver snart – kandidat på en uddannelse med fokus på engineering, matematisk modellering, statistik, data science eller lignende
er nysgerrig og god til at forvandle kompleksitet til enkle løsninger
er god til at forstå og formidle teknisk viden enkelt og letforståeligt 
er analytisk og har en god talforståelse

Managing our equipment inventory
Replacing hard drives/memory/transceivers and other hardware related tasks as required by our server and network teams



 WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

About Netskope
 Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.


 As a member of the Netskope Private Access team you will play an integral role in the continued development of our new Zero-Trust Secure Access product, a cloud-native service for secure access to private enterprise applications in both the public cloud and the data center, that reduces risk by providing zero trust application access instead of network access. Click here for more about Netskope Private Access.
 Responsibilities

Develop features for Netskope private access with performance and scale in mind
Interact with product management and Quality Engineering to drive the features

Qualifications/Requirements

8+ years of industry experience building high-performance networking software using socket programming.
Experience in enterprise network and security technologies (firewalls, VPN, PKI/TLS etc.)
Good fundamentals of TCP/IP
Programming mastery in C/C++
Experience with unit testing is a MUST
Good understanding of multi-threading, algorithms and data structures
Good knowledge of Linux at a systems level

An analytical builder creating and optimizing data solutions.

WHO WE ARE
 Biofire Technologies is on a mission to give gun owners better tools for reducing preventable gun injuries and deaths, especially among children. We believe our technology, combined with a best-in-class customer experience, will define the future of firearms safety for the next generation. Our mission-driven approach has earned support from the firearm community, the tech world, and the media.
 Biofire employees are world-class engineers who have designed and tested firearms, medical devices, robots, cars, satellites, rockets, and supersonic jets. What unites our team is our commitment to safety and reliability that we bring to our work every day.


 OUR CULTURE
 Reducing accidental firearm injuries and deaths requires original thinking and authentic collaboration, so we're deeply invested in building a team and culture that can achieve our mission together. Team members enjoy autonomy and flexibility from day one, so expect to be immediately tasked with solving challenging problems and building new systems that work. We'll hold you accountable for executing on audacious goals, giving and receiving honest feedback, and helping your teammates succeed. You'll receive respect, kindness, and support from every direction while you figure out how to get it all done.


 ABOUT THE ROLE
 As a Data Engineer at Biofire you will be responsible for building and maintaining scalable pipelines, structuring data and building tools that enable your teammates to succeed across the company. You will be a champion for bringing data into day to day operations, doing the technical heavy lifting to power the company's work and supporting and training other members of the team to build on top of the foundation you create. To succeed you will need to be able to programmatically work with data at scale, spot opportunities where data could accelerate the team, and continuously improve Biofire's overall data environment. You will need to be a curious problem-solver, rapidly learning Biofire's business problems and determining how to help solve them with data. If you're excited about advancing Biofire's mission through data, we encourage you to apply.


 KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
 Day to day responsibilities of the role will include:

Data pipeline development, management, and optimization;
Centrally integrating and structuring data across the company, creating a common ontology on which the company can build;
Partnering with stakeholders across the company to develop data-driven solutions for their use cases;
Training teammates on data, workflows, and tools, to ensure every member of the team is equipped to utilize their data;
Proactively identifying opportunities to bring data into day-to-day business operations and engaging the relevant stakeholders to build them.



 COMPENSATION, BENEFITS & PERKS
 We'll need you to bring your very best, so we give you what you need to do a great job. You'll enjoy flexible hours, teammates you will like, respect, and be inspired by, and all the technical resources you might need at our Broomfield office.
 In addition to our competitive pay and stock options, Biofire offers fully covered medical, dental, and vision benefits, a funded Health Spending Account, unlimited PTO (that team members actually use - we promise), a 401(k) with employer matching, and a 14 week parental leave policy. We deliver perks including noise-canceling headphones, the premium music streaming service of your choice, and anything else you'd need to succeed in your role (within reason).
 This is a full-time, salaried role with a flexible work-from-home policy. The compensation range for this role is $120K-$150K.


 QUALIFICATIONS
 If you think you will succeed in this role, and love the work you'll do, we encourage you to apply regardless of your background. We evaluate candidates based on their unique talents and fit for our needs, not a rigid list of qualifications.


 LOCATION AND HOURS
 Our dog-friendly, state-of-the-art headquarters is located in beautiful Broomfield, Colorado, between Boulder and Denver. Most roles require team members to frequently collaborate in person, but you will enjoy the flexibility to work from home when you need to. We trust you to communicate with your team to make things work.


 DIVERSITY & INCLUSION
 We're bringing innovation to a technological problem that has persisted for decades, so we depend on diverse, inclusive, and collaborative teams to break new ground and do great work. We welcome people from all qualified backgrounds, and we don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, political affiliation, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

Applicants must be (a) a citizen of the United States; (b) a lawful permanent resident of the United States (""Green Card"" holder); or (c) a person admitted into the United States as an asylee or refugee to be considered for the position.

Du er dermed i de bedste omgivelser til at opnå en bred erfaring og lære best practice indenfor data science og engineering. Du skal være med til at udvikle intelligente, automatiserede og skalerbare løsninger til PFA’s kunder og rådgivere, på tværs af de digitale kanaler – og baseret på innovativ brug af data. Vi har aktuelt fokus på PFA’s produkter inden for rådgivning, forebyggelse og sundhed, hvor der sker en masse spændende udvikling. Som AI & Data graduate er du under hele forløbet en del af samme team med én leder, men dine opgaver dækker hele AI & Data værdikæden i krydsfeltet mellem de tre teams - fra idé og koncept til data engineering, udvikling af algoritmer, produktionssætning og platformsudvikling.
 Som AI & Data graduate skal du:

 være en del af PFA’s AI- og data-community og befinde dig i spændingsfeltet mellem data engineering, data science, machine learning, softwareudvikling, DevOps og CloudOps
 opbygge en bred dataprofil
 være med til at udvikle produkter end-to-end
 forstå forretningsbehov og oversætte dem til data- og teknologidrevne løsninger
 lære alt om et dataprodukts livscyklus – fra fødsel til drift.

 ”Vi går efter at finde en graduate der – ligesom os – er passioneret for data science og for at skabe nye løsninger og mærkbar forskel for de mange kunder, der besøger vores digitale platforme, og for vores kollegaer i PFA. Du får masser af plads til at bruge din analytiske sans og din nysgerrighed i et kreativt og spændende community, hvor vi arbejder på kanten af den nyeste teknologi og har end-to-end-kapabilitet fra forretningsidé til produktionssætning i it-systemerne,” siger Johannes Eichler Waage, der er leder af AI Technology & Platform i PFA.
 To år med accelereret faglig og personlig udvikling
 Som graduate i PFA bliver du en del af et tæt fællesskab med andre graduates, så du opbygger netværk og udveksler erfaringer. Du er på bootcamps, hvor du optimerer din professionelle værktøjskasse med træning i bl.a. problemløsning, innovation og facilitering. Du er også i netværk, der fokuserer på din personlige udvikling, og gennem hele graduate programmet er du tilknyttet en mentor, der sparrer med dig og støtter dig.
 Graduates er PFA’s bud på fremtiden, og derfor bliver du hurtigt en attraktiv kollega på alle niveauer i huset. Du bliver fastansat og som udgangspunktet tilknyttet én forretningsenhed gennem hele forløbet på 24 måneder. Programmet er designet til, at du udvikler dig både fagligt og personligt i høj fart.
 Kan du se dig selv?
 Som graduate i PFA skal du have en kandidatgrad, og det er sikkert 1-2 år siden, du dimitterede. Du mener, at PFA’s kundeejede struktur og samfundsansvarlige agenda er helt rigtig. Du trives med at arbejde med komplekse problemstillinger og forvandle dem til innovative løsninger, og du har evner, vilje og interesse for at blive klogere - og for at spille dine kollegaer gode. Du:

 er – eller bliver snart – kandidat på en uddannelse med fokus på engineering, matematisk modellering, statistik, data science eller lignende
 er nysgerrig og god til at forvandle kompleksitet til enkle løsninger
 er god til at forstå og formidle teknisk viden enkelt og letforståeligt
 er analytisk og har en god talforståelse
 er åben, nysgerrig og ser værdi i at samarbejde med andre.

 Det får du også med
 Som kollega i PFA kan du mærke handling bag visionen om en bæredygtig high performance kultur med fokus på sundhed, trivsel og arbejdsglæde. Du har fx mulighed for at arbejde hjemme i op til to dage om ugen og ret til at gå ned på 80% arbejdstid. Vores nyrenoverede domicil få meter fra Nordhavn Metro og havnemiljøet, giver en attraktiv fysisk ramme. Socialt har vi mange tilbud som yoga, løbehold, fredagscafé og en masse medarbejderklubber. Men vigtigst af alt, så har vi fokus på det gode kollegaskab. Det er nemlig det bedste afsæt for at sætte vores faglighed i spil og levere det bedste for vores kunder.

Data is an incredibly important asset to Lind Capital, and this is your opportunity to join our digital business transformation and help shape the future of our data and support the growth of our company.

 Our Company
 In Lind Capital, we trade the financial markets. We have no external clients. Instead, we trade at our own risk and benefit. Technology and data are essential to our business, and about 1/3 of our 50+ colleagues work directly with tech.

 Your Team
 You will be a part of the team responsible for our company-wide data foundation. The team is anchored in the technology department, which currently consists of 17 Software and Data Engineers. We work closely with our Quantitative Research team, who are the key data consumers. The QR team consists of 4 Data Scientists, working on business-oriented analyses in primarily Python.

 The main tasks of your team are to develop and maintain solutions to collect, process, and manage large amounts of unstructured and structured data to build solutions supporting data-intensive analysis. To take our data management to the next level, we are looking for a new Data Engineer to join our team, and if you are skilled in building solutions to bring raw data into actionable output, you will be able to make a big impact in our organisation.

 We run our data management setup across an in-house developed service and job architecture built in C# and Python, hosted on Docker/Kubernetes, as well as a more classic Data Warehouse architecture on MS SQL server.

 You Make the Difference
 Hard tech skills are required, but personality makes the difference. We strive for a cooperative work environment with a high level of knowledge sharing. A work environment where everybody assumes personal responsibility.

 The trading strategies, we pursue, are all based on a complex combination of tech, data, numbers, and market know-how. This means your ability to go beyond your comfort zone and engage with experts in other areas is paramount to our success.

 Not Sure This is Your Thing?
 Don’t worry. Drop us a line and we can have an informal chat and see if there is something to build on. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Head of Data, Jeppe Abrahamsen, at jab@lindcapital.com / +45 28 15 60 04

 Note that while being a Danish speaker is not a prerequisite, we do require a Danish/EU work permit.

 Please no recruiters, no agencies, no consultants.

About Netskope
 Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive. Visit us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter@Netskope.
