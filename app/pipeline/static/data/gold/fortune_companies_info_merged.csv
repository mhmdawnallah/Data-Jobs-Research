In just over four years, we operate on two nationwide networks, have over 200,000 active devices and generate over 50 million dollars in annual revenue. Ting Internet launched in the US in 2015. In December 2015, Gizmodo listed us as one of The 6 Best Things That Happened to the Internet This Year. We are investing millions in fiber networks and partnering with small towns to change what people expect from their Internet service and their Internet service provider. We have already launched Gigabit speed Internet service in Charlottesville, Virginia, Westminster, Maryland and Holly Springs, North Carolina and we just announced that we will be coming to Centennial, Colorado. OpenSRS was the first wholesale domain name registrar when it launched in 1999 and is now the largest in the world, managing nearly 15 million domain names and millions of value-added services through a global reseller network of over 13,000 web hosts and ISPs across six continents. Hover makes it easy for individuals and small businesses to manage their domain names and email addresses. Our easy-to-use management tools and extraordinary customer support earned us top mention in Lifehacker's Five Best Domain Name Registrars and, more importantly, regularly delights over 250,000 customers.

His simple but highly effective philosophy of satisfying customers, small or big, through a mix of honesty, integrity and social awareness has become ingrained in all aspects of the business and is truly responsible for the group's unrivaled success. During the early years, the organization was primarily involved in trading activities. As the Emirates forged themselves into a single nation, a pressing need was felt to diversify in to other areas of commercial activity to contribute to the fledging nation's economy. For this, heavy investment was undertaken in the core sector of construction which has in the long run benefited both the country as well as the group. Juma Al Majid partnership ventures' operate in the fields of shipping, construction, food-Imports, general trading, travel and other industries. The group is also active in financial investments and portfolio management across the region and globally.

For a start, we listen to our customers and then deliver on what they really want when it comes to banking. Ease, value, trust - these are the things that customers want, and so these are the hallmarks of all the products that we offer. To make life easier for our customers, all the products and services we offer are available online, on your mobile and over the phone. Most of our customers enjoy the convenience of buying and servicing their accounts online, and our call centres in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Newcastle are open seven days a week. Our colleagues are not set individual sales targets and do not receive incentives. This is because we want the focus to be on listening to customers and serving their needs. We also believe wholeheartedly in the importance of rewarding loyalty when customers choose to buy or use our products, and we do this by offering Clubcard points to customers on almost all of their spending. Today, we pride ourselves on our range of simple and convenient retail banking and insurance products designed specifically to meet the needs of Tesco customers. We believe that every little help makes a big difference, and by putting the customer first and rewarding their loyalty, we're offering something we believe every bank should.","Tesco Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tesco, which gives us the freedom to make decisions based on what we really think is best for our customers.",tescobank.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Together with the iDM Hygienik fresh water technology, hot water is produced just in time directly from the pipe. The company was founded in Matrei in East Tyrol in 1977 as one of the first enterprises for solar plants and heat pumps in Austria. The first innovation in the late 70ies was the so-called ""4-season-heating"", a system composed of an air source heat pump for spring and autumn, a solar plant for the summer and a wood stove for the cold winters. In 1987, IDM launched systems that not only used solar energy for hot water production, but also delivered solar energy into the heating circuit.","iDM (Idea Development Matrei) Energy Systems offer heat pumps for heating, cooling and hot water production.",idm-energie.at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We want to share ideas because we believe it results in better medicines. We want the way we work to be inclusive, open and collaborative. This approach runs through all that we do. We focus on three main therapy areas - Oncology, Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease (CVMD) and Respiratory - and we are also selectively active in the areas of autoimmunity, neuroscience and infection. To put ourselves in the best position to push the boundaries of science, we seek to leverage our combination of capabilities, which encompass both small molecules and biologics, and include immunotherapies and developing innovative delivery devices that can offer choice to patients. These are reinforced by a strong focus on personalised healthcare capabilities, which aim to match medicines only to those patients who will benefit from them. Our teams also work alongside the world's leading academic and biotech research institutions to stimulate innovation and evaluate emerging technologies such as Modified RNA and CRISPR genome editing.

That experience inspired us to create Sahale Snacks. We went back to our kitchens and created unique combinations of premium nuts, dried fruits, and interesting spices, each reflecting a beautiful location, culture and/or culinary tradition somewhere in the world. We use whole ingredients in their natural form -- such as cashews, almonds, pecans, pumpkin seeds, and peanuts -- and combine them with dried and preservative-free (unsulphured) fruits, then add fabulous ingredients like organic honey, lemongrass, balsamic vinegar, Moroccan harissa or pure ground Madagascar vanilla beans.

The scale and pace of urbanization in Pakistan is relatively high. By 2030 or earlier, its urban population is likely to equal its rural population. The impact of urbanization will be felt in all spheres of human life including a complex set of environmental, economic and social challenges. However, there is a unique opportunity to build more sustainable, vibrant, innovative and equitable communities. Finding solutions for a better urban future involves developing new forms of collaboration and partnerships. Inspired by the possibilities of this new urban era, and driven by a belief in innovation through collaboration across traditional divides, The Urban Unit seeks to improve the way people live, work and play in the future cities of Pakistan and elsewhere. The concept of urban design and development addresses both the functional and aesthetic aspects of the City's built environment. Aesthetics, being the traditional concern of urban design can only be more meaningful when combined and integrated with other functional units such as environmental management, urban planning and transport management, information and communication management and institutional development to generate an environment that is visually pleasant, socially comfortable, and economically viable and which conveys a sense of place, pride and belonging. Urban design activities and efforts will seek to develop a policy framework and guidelines integrated with technology driven approaches and solutions so as to create a sustainable living environment and an appropriate city image and identity.","According to a report of the United Nations, the world urban population is expected to become 6.",urbanunit.gov.pk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three Business students who were fond of MP3 players decided to start their own web shop, with two goals in mind: to become millionaires and to create a company that other companies would see as an example regarding customer service. Within a couple of years Coolblue has turned into an award-winning company, praised for its surprising ways of amazing customers with their obsessive focus on service.","Who we areCoolblue is one of the largest online shops in the Netherlands & Belgium, and has only one goal: Making customers smile.",coolblue.nl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
