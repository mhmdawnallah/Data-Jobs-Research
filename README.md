# âœ¨ Background
I was looking to better understand what skills where being requested of **entry-level data engineer** to learn the most in-demand ones. I felt the best place to start was website jobs including Linkedin job postings, so this is my start at this project.

# ðŸŽ¯ End-Goals
- Getting the latest updates of DE jobs.
- Getting the most in-demand job skills required for Data Engineering Positions depending on seniority level.
- Better understanding the data engineering market (is it contracting, expanding)
- Tracking the most in-demand skills over time
- Forecasting, if possible, the skills that will be in greater or lesser demand in the next year
