- Enforcing putting mesaures in fact table although it is a factless fact table
- Not defining the grain beforehand
- Using autoincremental surrogate key in date dimension I should use meaningful one instead like: YYYYMMDD
- Using abbreviations in Dimension Table and It should be more verbose to provide descriptive context
- Nulls in Dimension Table I should use 'not applicable' or something meaniful because database engines treat nulls while slicing and dicing data in different ways
- Urge to normalize dimension table instead of flattened denormalized dimension tables
- Measures're not compliant with the facts in the Fact Table
- Not putting slowly changing dimensions beforehand
- Not using default value in Date Dimension for case that may be date dimension is not coming from data source
- Not taking care about Average could be misleading with null values in facts
- Not considering lookup table for abbreviations for example
- Not Considering Role playing dimension i.e: Location because Location could be a role playing dimesnion for Job and Company
